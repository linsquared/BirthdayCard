# BirthdayCard

'It's your birthday' is a quick birthday card generator. 

This was my mini Hackathon project for Brainstation's full-stack bootcamp. We were tasked to use API to design and build a webpage in under 20 hours. 'It's your birthday' was made using html, SASS, Javascript, NASA API, herokuapp API and quotable API. 

If you ever had issues with figuring out what to write on a birthday card (or any celebratory card)  to friends, colleagues or a loved ones,  try our birthday card generator and save the headaches. 

You can select a date for your card and in return, an astronomy picture taken by NASA on that specific date.  Along with the image, users can select up to 3 desirable categories of quotes for the special day. The options are: random Ron Swanson Quotes, random quotes or you may enter a category of quotes, ie: love, friendship, technology etc.

(Note: NASA Astronomy Picture Of the Day program started in June 1995, therefore, the first available image was dated on June 20, 1995)
